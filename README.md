# **RadFlow MFA Implementation**

## **Project Overview**
This repository contains the implementation of a robust Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) system for **RadFlow 360**. The goal is to provide enhanced security features by integrating MFA via SMS and Authenticator Apps, allowing both users and admins to manage their MFA preferences seamlessly.

---

## **Key Features**
- **MFA for Login**:
  - Support for SMS-based or Authenticator App-based MFA during user login.
- **User Settings**:
  - Enable/disable MFA, switch methods, and regenerate backup codes.
- **Admin Controls**:
  - Manage MFA settings for users (enable/disable/reset) and view MFA logs.
- **Enhanced Security**:
  - Secure storage of MFA preferences, rate-limiting, and real-time logging of failed attempts.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core, Dapper (for database interaction)
- **Frontend**: Razor Views (for user/admin interfaces)
- **Database**: SQL Server (or your preferred relational database)
- **MFA Methods**:
  - SMS (via **Twilio API**)
  - Authenticator Apps (using **TOTP** via `Base32Encoding` and QR code generation with **QRCoder**)
- **Security**: BCrypt (for password hashing), Data Protection API (for encrypted storage)

---

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
- .NET SDK 5.0 or newer
- SQL Server
- Twilio Account for SMS-based MFA

### **Steps to Run the Project**
1. **Clone the Repository**:

   cd RadFlowMFA
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Restore NuGet packages using:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Add the following in your `.env` file:

   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
   TOTP_SECRET_KEY=your_totp_secret_key
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Run the SQL migration script located in `/Migrations` to set up the database schema.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   Access the application at `https://localhost:5001`.
